// Deletion is a mark, and the mark is undone or made good after GRACE.
//
// An emptied pad is marked: it drops out of its root's list and its links go
// quiet, and saving it again unmarks it. A deleted root is marked with every
// pad in it, at one time, and every browser is signed out of it; its old
// password reclaims it, unmarking what was marked with it, and a fresh claim
// purges it first. Whatever is still marked after GRACE is purged: the sealed
// pads, their links and, for a root, its password, unlocks and devices.
//
// The tables are made by db.ts, shares.ts and auth.ts; these statements are
// prepared on first use, so this module only needs the database.
